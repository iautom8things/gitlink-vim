gitlink-vim
===========

Generate a link to the exact commit, file and line.

When collaborating with your team, you may often want to reference a line of code.  Copy-and-pasting the line just doesn't work when context matters, plus you know the formating isn't going to be right, anyways!

##Known Issues

As written, it only works for Github and Gitlab.  Bitbucket is not supported.

##Installation
